These are the homework exercises from Andrew Ng's Coursera course on
Machine Learning, except instead of using Matlab/Octave, I've done the
exercises in Python using numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. I completed
all of the Octave exercises and thought it would be instructive to go
through them with Python.

2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex2)
3. [Multiclass Classification and Neural Networks](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex3)
4. [Neural Networks](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex4)
5. [Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex5)
6. [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex6)
7. [K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/wesbarnett/MachineLearning/tree/master/ex7)
8. Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems - TODO
