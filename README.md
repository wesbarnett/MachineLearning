# Machine Learning in Python

These are completed homework exercises from [Andrew Ng's Coursera
course on Machine
Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), except
instead of using Matlab/Octave as required by the course, I've done
the exercises in Python. If the exercise called for writing one's own
routine or function in Octave, I generally tried to do the same think
with pandas and numpy and then do it a third time using scikit-learn.
Sometimes this meant rewriting some of the provided Octave routines.
